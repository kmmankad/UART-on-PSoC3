Basic UART
--------------

This project demonstrates basic Interrupt based UART on the PSoC3/5.

A Byte RX'd triggers an Interrupt Service Routine,that clears the interrupt and prints the recd' byte to a 16x2 Character LCD.

This is a very elementary code example,and not in any way a project of any sort.

Tested with PSoC Creator 2.0 on the CY8CKIT-030.
